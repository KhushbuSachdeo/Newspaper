					<p>The popular reality show 'Bigg Boss' of the small screen has been a pride of television for many years. The show has completed its 17 seasons, and amid this, the makers also started Bigg Boss OTT, whose first season came in the year 2020. Now it is speculated that 'Bigg Boss OTT 3' will soon be broadcast on Jio Cinema, and along with this, some information regarding which celebrity guests will be part of it has also surfaced.
					</p>
					<h4>Who can be the contestants in Bigg Boss OTT 3?</h4>
					<p>

Currently, there is no official information about which celebrities will appear as contestants in 'Bigg Boss OTT 3'. However, several names have emerged in media reports. These include names like Daljeet Kaur, Pratiksha Honmukh, Sana Sayyad, and Shoaib Ibrahim.
<br>
As usual, the makers have not shared the details of the contestants, but the speculations are often accurate. Vicky Jain, the husband of Ankita Lokhande who gained fame from Bigg Boss 17, could also be a part of this season's OTT show. In addition to these, the name of Esha Malviya is also emerging as a contestant. According to reports, some YouTubers have also been approached for Bigg Boss OTT 3.<br>

					<h2 align="center ">Trips To Manali</h2>
					<p>&nbsp;There are many memorable moments in every man‚Äôs life. However, a few of them get indelibly etched in our memories. One of my most memorable moments is associated with a wonderful holiday at Manali. Travelling breaks the monotony of our routine. Thank God, there are so many beautiful places visiting which, we forget all the stresses and cares of our life! I got an opportunity to travel to one such place of extreme natural beauty, where peace and the pristine pastoral charm has not been affected by the modern industrial competition. During the summer vacation, I got the chance to visit Manali and the adjoining spots.<br><br>



The best part was the journey to Manali. We set out early in the morning. The heat of the season began dwindling as our car went up the serpentine roads in the Himalayas. The drive from Sundar Nagar to Manali was a real treat to the eyes. On either side of the serpentine road breathtaking vistas of unmatched sylvan beauty soothed not only the eyes, but the restive soul also. Deep dells, with pure verdant slopes; idyllic, pastoral human settlements, glimpses of the far off white sheep grazing on the slopes of the mountains under the canopy of azure sky are the enthralling views one gets as a gift for coming to this paradise. I did not want the drive to end. As we neared Manali, the mountains became taller and taller. The peace, tranquility, and spledour of Manali and its surroundings were supernal.



My father had intentionally got a hotel booked on the banks of river Beas where the nature was abundant. From the room window, the distant snow clad white mountains gave the illusion as if we are in a different world. At night we went on foot to the market for dinner. First time in my life I saw the magnificence of the night sky. I did not know there were so many stars in the sky. For, in the city the pollution hides this glory of the sky from the human eye. We were fully refreshed by our short stay at Manali. The beauty of Rohtang Pass, Solang Valley, Hadimba Temple were beautiful; but far more beautiful was the journey itself. I will always cherish the sweet memories of this journey.
